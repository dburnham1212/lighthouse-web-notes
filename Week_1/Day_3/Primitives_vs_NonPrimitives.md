# Primitives vs Non Primitives
## The Six Primitive Types in JavaScript

The six types of primitives are:
-undefined
-null
-boolean
-string
-number
-symbol (Introduced in ES6 and not something we need to focus on right now)

Primitives are essential building blocks of data because they represent the simplest possible type of data that our software can have.

## Objects Are Not Primitives

Anything not in that list (for example, a Date) is an Object. Objects are not primitive data types.

Arrays and functions are technically a sub-category of objects. Objects (including arrays and functions and other types of objects) have properties.

The six primitive types, plus object, make up the seven fundamental types of JavaScript.
