# TCP
TCP, which stands for Transmission Control Protocol, provides a standard that allows machines to speak to each other.

TCP based communication allows two machines to establish an open channel for two-way data communication. Once a connection is established, both parties can start sending and receiving data until one of them decides that it's had enough and decides to terminate the connection. 

Just like with a phone call, there is always one side which dials a specific number to establish a connection to the other side. In computer networking, this number is as an IP Address. A computer can have many network-based applications running, much like how a company can have many different offices. For this reason, someone decided to effectively allow for specific phone number extensions. These are referred to as ports in computer networking.
