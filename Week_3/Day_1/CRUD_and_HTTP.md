# CRUD

Almost all web applications allow users to manipulate data in various ways, which we typically break down into four categories: Create, Read, Update and Delete.

```
Create - Add a new record

Read - Retrieve the value of a record

Update - Update a record's value

Delete - Delete a record
```

The primary or most-commonly-used HTTP verbs (or methods, as they are properly called) are POST, GET, PUT, and DELETE. These correspond to create, read, update, and delete (or CRUD) operations, respectively. The following shows how most common HTTP methods correspond with CURD actions.

```
Create - POST

Read - GET

Update - PUT

Delete - DELETE
```
